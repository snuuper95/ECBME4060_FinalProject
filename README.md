# ECBME4060_FinalProject
Mouse Embryonic Development Analysis

Hello Dr. Cheng,

Here you will find our groups final project where we dive into the analysis of developing mouse embryonic cells. We had to constrain our analysis to a subset of the total data as google collaboratory and our computers could not handle the full data set (around 170,000 X 25,000 cells by genes matrix) for processing.


"Final_Project_ECBME4060.ipynb" <-- All of our work is contained in this single Google Collab Notebook.

The data files can be found publicly at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123046
For our code to work you will need csvs from E3.5, E4.5, and E5.5 from the above link. Alternatively you can download the tarfile and extract everything (although this may take an extensive amount of time).

The original source for the paper we based our work off of is: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1127-1#data-availability


Thanks for the great semester!

Best,
Anna Schoonen, Shashwat Shukla, Caleb Lee, Nicholas Nolan
