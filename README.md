# ECBME4060_FinalProject
Mouse Embryonic Development Analysis

Hello,

Here you will find our groups final project where we dive into the analysis of developing mouse embryonic cells. We had to constrain our analysis to a subset of the total data as google collaboratory and our computers could not handle the full data set (around 170,000 X 25,000 cells by genes matrix) for processing.

Best,
Anna Schoonen, Shashwat Shukla, Caleb Lee, Nicholas Nolan
